Arin the Frostweaver had spent a decade perfecting spells of ice and snow, never once touching a spark of flame magic. 
When the blood wars began, he defended the front line against armies of orcs.
When the orc horde stormed the frozen gates, Arin unleashed a roaring inferno that turned the ramparts to ashes. 
After the battle, he restored the shattered walls with a delicate frost-seal, leaving the keepâ€™s icy facade unblemished.
In the end, he died as a hero, an unmatched fire mage.
